<small><em>The gender information of named entities is important for many text analysis tasks such as gender bias detection and targeted advertising. Despite its valuable use cases, gender tagging of named entities has traditionally been database-reliant. The lack of open-source benchmarks is a major impediment to exploring the effectiveness of machine learning-based methods for this task. Towards this goal, the article serves two main purposes. Firstly, we create four open-source datasets from well-known NER corpora and make them publicly available. Secondly, we propose a novel supervised learning approach based on the transformer network to identify the gender of named entities. We evaluate the proposed approach on four gender identification datasets. The proposed method outperforms two commercial database-reliant approaches and five deep sequence models, including BERT.</em><br/></small>

				<li>Resilience of Named Entity Recognition Models Under Adversarial Attack.<br/><small>DADC Workshop, NAACL 2022</small><br/><small><a href="javascript:unhide('dadc-naacl2022tldr');">TL;DR</a> | <a href="">Paper</a> | <a href="javascript:unhide('dadc-naacl2022bib');">BibTeX</a></small><div id="dadc-naacl2022tldr" class="hidden"><br/>
<small><em>Named entity recognition (NER) is a popular language processing task with wide applications. Progress in NER has been noteworthy, as evidenced by the F1 scores obtained on standard datasets. In practice, however, the end-user uses an NER model on their dataset out-of-the-box, on text that may not be pristine. In this paper we present four model-agnostic adversarial attacks to gauge the resilience of NER models in such scenarios. Our experiments on four state-of-the-art NER methods with five English datasets suggest that the NER models are over-reliant on case information and do not utilise contextual information well. As such, they are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks based on these features.</em><br/></small>

				<li>Better Textbooks with Human Language Technology.<br/><small>Doctoral Consortium, SIGIR 2018</small><br/><small><a href="javascript:unhide('dc-sigir2018tldr');">TL;DR</a> | <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210228">Paper</a> | <a href="javascript:unhide('dc-sigir2018bib');">BibTeX</a></small><div id="dc-sigir2018tldr" class="hidden"><br/>
<small><em>Textbooks are widely used as the primary teaching and learning material all over the world, by students and teachers alike. Due to the pervasive nature of textbooks, it is of foremost importance to ensure that textbooks adhere to certain standards, such as being free from all biases, and being structured to provide an optimal learning experience for the student. In order to verify compliance with these criteria, subject experts are required to comprehensively study the material at hand. This is a costly exercise. In this paper, we propose a feasible alternative to reduce the costs associated with three such tasks: (a) identification of gender bias in textbooks, (b) optimal ordering of concepts in a textbook, and (c) generating supplementary study material at the same difficulty level. The aim is to improve the quality of textbooks with minimal manual intervention. We propose leveraging the large volume of structured and unstructured data available on the web using IR techniques to automate the process of checking the quality of textbooks.</em><br/></small>
